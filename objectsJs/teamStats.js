//TEAM STATS.
// We want to create, retrieve, and add information about your favorite sports team. Basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. Itâ€™s your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays and objects.

//declare an object named [team], it should contain two properties that should not be reassigned directly, one named players and games, these must be arrays filled with three different players descriptions (first name, last name, and age), and three different games info(opponent, teamPoints, and opponent points.).
